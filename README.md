# Shopping List
Another list application. This time I tried to combine B Traversy's way of doing it with a little bit of mine from the task list I created
before doing the task list in the course. My task list is in the task-list repo. Some of the code like th filter and the method of  
removing list items and getting and setting local storage are still taken directly from the Modern JavaScript from the beginning course. 
So is the load event listeners function and the global variables. My task list did not use global variables or a function for loading
event listeners. There was no filter functionality either. This has all that. I might do one more that uses more of my methodology, but
this has helped me solidify the concepts from the beginning of the course.
